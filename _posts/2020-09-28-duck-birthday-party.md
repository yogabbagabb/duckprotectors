## Introduction!

You are invited to a birthday party for a very special duck, Penguin. Here's a picture of Penguin:

### Details

This birthday party will take place on **November 20th, 2022 from 12:00pm BST - 4:00pm BST** at People's Park Tavern (in Hackney, London) in the Greenhouse.

## Requests
- Please RSVP by November 3rd, 2022 5:55 pm BST.
- You can bring any humans you want (e.g friend, parent, partner, relative, duck etc). Just let me know your headcount! I think the pub also allows dogs, but please check with them first.
- I will be travelling from far away that day, which makes it difficult for me to fully arrange for your eating and drinking. Please eat a lunch or brunch before you come. That said, I will give each of you £10 to purchase anything you like at the pub. I will also bring some fruits and what the British call "crisps" (y'all Brits are so cute).
- Penguin practices तपस्या (*tapasya*), which is best described as "ascetic like fervor." 
  - Penguin will, thus, not be accepting any gifts.
  - Penguin also dresses rather simply. You are, thus, encouraged to spare yourself the headache of dressing up in those silly outfits that humans wear. It may be cold in the pub's greenhouse, so warm clothing is encouraged.
